Automatically switches websites between light and dark mode based on your system's color preference.

## Features

- üåì **Seamless Switching:** Applies light or dark theme to websites based on your system settings.
- ‚úÖ **Smart Detection:** Intelligently skips websites that already have their own dark mode.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero Configuration:** Install and forget - works automatically without any setup.

## Install

Get it from the [Chrome Web Store](YOUR_CHROME_WEB_STORE_LINK).

*(Replace YOUR_CHROME_WEB_STORE_LINK with the actual URL)*
*(Replace YOUR_EXTENSION_ID in the badge URL above with your extension's ID)*


## How it Works

DayNight Mode monitors your system's color scheme preference (`prefers-color-scheme`). When dark mode is active on your system, it applies a carefully crafted dark theme to webpages while preserving readability and usability. Sites that already implement their own dark mode are automatically detected and skipped.

## Tech Stack

Built using the modern [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) framework and TypeScript.
